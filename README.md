# Handwritten Digit Recognition
Hello World!! of Neural Network </br>
Handwritten digit recognition is the ability of computers to recognize human handwritten digits.</br>
I have taken refrences from a blog on Mnist handwritten digit classification using tensorflow
by milindsoorya.</br>

# Handwritten-digit-recognition-MNIST-USING-Tensorflow

I have used MNIST(Modified Nattional Institute of Standard and Technology) Dataset by importing it 
from keras. </br>
The MNIST database is a large collection of handwritten digits.
</br>
It has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples
